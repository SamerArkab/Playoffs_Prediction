# Playoff Prediction Web App

This is a Flask web application that predicts playoff status for baseball teams based on various input features. It uses a trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to make predictions.

## Features

- Predicts playoff status for baseball teams based on input data.
- Uses a PostgreSQL database to store input data and predictions.
- Allows users to input data through a web form and see the prediction result.
